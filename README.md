# FriendFinder

This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Please go to this link to view Friend Finder xxx

The survey can also be found on my portfolio under "Friend Finder" here xxx

Before You Begin
Check out this demo version of the site. Use this as a model for how we expect your assignment look and operate.

A folder called FriendFinder has been created. Inside the folder, organize your directories so it matches the following:

├── app
|  ├── data
|  |  └── friends.js
|  ├── public
|  |  ├── home.html
|  |  └── survey.html
|  └── routing
|     ├── apiRoutes.js
|     └── htmlRoutes.js
├── package.json
└── server.js
Instructions
The survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
